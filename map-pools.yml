    # Voted pools support modifiers which come in the form of a formula (does not affect any other type of pool).
    #
    # This formula is parsed by exp4j library, it's quite flexible and supports many built-in functions.
    #
    # On top of that PGM implements:
    # - bound(val, min, max)
    #
    # Available variables:
    #  - score: the maps' score, determined by percentage of players who voted for it, or a default
    #  - same_gamemode: amount of other maps of the same gamemode already picked for the vote
    #  - mapsize: the size for this map in total players (sum of all team counts)
    #  - players: amount of active players online (eg: obs count as half)
    #
    # WARNING: this is a complicated setting to modify on your own, it is not
    #          recommended to modify it on your own unless you know what you're doing.
    #
    # The provided formula can dynamically pick best-sized map for a current player count, some alternatives:
    #  - Make it so low scores are less-likely than higher scores (previous default)
    #    pow(score, 2)
    #  - Make it so repeated gamemodes on the same vote are 35% less likely each time, down to a minimum of 20%
    #    pow(score * bound(1 - (0.35 * same_gamemode), 0.2, 1), 2)
    modifier: >-
