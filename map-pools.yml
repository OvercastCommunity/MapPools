    # Voted pool only: num of maps to show each vote

    # Voted pool only: modify how score behaves
    score:
      # How much score should maps start with by default.
      default: 0.3 # 30%
      # How much score decreases/increases after each match. Null to be proportional to amount of maps.
      decay: 0.01 # 1%
      rise: 0.002 # 0.2% - Should be around default/map_count
      # When a map is voted, enforce that it never falls out of the range of:
      min-after-vote: 0.15 # 15%
      max-after-vote: 0.45 # 45%
      # Maps with less than this are ignored for a vote
      min-for-vote: 0.02 # 2%
      # After the map plays, reset the score to:
      # Supports a formula with play_minutes
      after-playing: bound(play_minutes - 30, 0, 60) * -0.01

    # Voted pools support modifiers which come in the form of a formula (does not affect any other type of pool).
    #
    # This formula is parsed by exp4j library, it's quite flexible and supports many built-in functions.
    #
    # On top of that PGM implements:
    # - bound(val, min, max)
    #
    # Available variables:
    #  - score: the maps' score, determined by percentage of players who voted for it, or a default
    #  - same_gamemode: amount of other maps of the same gamemode already picked for the vote
    #  - mapsize: the size for this map in total players (sum of all team counts)
    #  - players: amount of active players online (eg: obs count as half)
    #
    # WARNING: this is a complicated setting to modify on your own, it is not
    #          recommended to modify it on your own unless you know what you're doing.
    #
    # The provided formula can dynamically pick best-sized map for a current player count, some alternatives:
    #  - Make it so low scores are less-likely than higher scores (previous default)
    #    pow(score, 2)
    #  - Make it so repeated gamemodes on the same vote are 35% less likely each time, down to a minimum of 20%
    #    pow(score * bound(1 - (0.35 * same_gamemode), 0.2, 1), 2)
    modifier: >-
      pow(
        score * 
        bound(1 - (0.2 * same_gamemode), 0.2, 1) *
        bound(0.5 * (
          tanh(bound(-0.0025 * players + 0.5, 0.2, 1) * (mapsize - bound(players * 1.05, 0, 90))) -
          tanh(bound(-0.0025 * players + 0.5, 0.2, 1) * (mapsize - bound(0.005 * players ^ 2 + 0.95 * players + 5, 10, 150)))
